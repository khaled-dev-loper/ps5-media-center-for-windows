# üéØ Challenge

This project started as a personal challenge:  
I wanted to see if I could bring the magic of the PlayStation 5's media experience to Windows, both as a technical exercise and a way to share something cool with the community.  
It's not just a tool‚Äîit's the result of countless hours of trial and error, all for the love of media and great user experiences.

I hope you'll enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed building it‚Äîand maybe you'll even get inspired to tinker, tweak, or extend it further!
